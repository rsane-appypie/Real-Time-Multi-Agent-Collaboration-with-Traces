   - AI-assisted selection of appropriate technologies and frameworks
   - Automated generation of directory structure and configuration files

3. **Code Generation**
   - AI-assisted implementation of core functionality
   - Automated generation of boilerplate code
   - AI-powered code reviews and optimizations

4. **Documentation**
   - AI-assisted creation of comprehensive documentation
   - Automated generation of README and setup instructions
   - AI-powered documentation updates

## Research & Development Technologies

### OpenAI Agents SDK
The project leverages the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) for building agentic AI applications. Key features implemented:

1. **Agent Architecture**
   - LLM-powered agents with custom instructions and tools
   - Handoff capabilities for task delegation between agents
   - Guardrails for input validation and safety

2. **Implementation Details**
   - Python-first approach for agent orchestration
   - Built-in agent loop for tool calling and result processing
   - Automatic schema generation and Pydantic validation

3. **Tracing and Monitoring**
   - Built-in tracing for workflow visualization
   - Debug and monitoring capabilities
   - Performance evaluation tools

### MLflow Integration
The project integrates [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/) for comprehensive machine learning lifecycle management:

1. **Experiment Tracking**
   - Model versioning and management
   - Parameter and metric logging
   - Artifact storage and management

2. **Tracing and Observability**
   - MLflow Tracing for GenAI workloads
   - Automated trace logging with OpenAI
   - Performance monitoring and analysis

3. **Model Management**
   - Model registry integration
   - Deployment tracking
   - Performance evaluation
